1. What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
The course is IB Computer Science for Grade 11 & 12 where students are also require to learn and write pseudocode.

2. What is the language? The language is Python programming language.

3. How does one write & run code in this language
One can simply start writing code in python by using online Python compilers such as: 
www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/
www.online-python.com/ and also downloading and IDE program such as pycharm.

Rate the complexity of the syntax. Python programming language is probably the lease complex language when compered to other object oriented progrmaming language, therefore I would rate it a 3/10 complexity.

Strengths: Very interactive, portable, many available libraries, object-oriented, versatile since this language permits the operator to try new things. Python is also  an interpreted language, implying that the code is implemented line by line. This is one of the features that makes it simple to use.

How would you utlilize the strengths in the class? Students can explore all kinds of different programs to write in python starting with the basics to the advanced level. Also, it can come in very handy to incorporate the other subjects that students learn such as physics, chemistry, math, and even biology in their programming language since python is very efficient to write data science related programs.

Weaknesses
There are some issues with the design of the language, which only gets displayed during runtime.

How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Teach students how to interpret error messages and research them. Also how to fix the code by themselves when errors arrive.

Why did you select this language for this class?
 Python is probably the easiest coding language to understand, since it  as simple and also flexible in what it can do.
