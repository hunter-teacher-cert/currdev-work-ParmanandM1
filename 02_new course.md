Come up with an idea for a new comptuer science course that you would teach at your current school.

Idea: Web Design & Hardware Course.

General description of the course:
The web design part of the course for high school students and middle school students also includes the basics of the language behind the web, HTML and CSS, along with planning and visual design aspects of web design. Students will be able to: Structuring a websiteâ€™s content, use creative problem-solving skils in web projects

The Hardware part of the course can teach students how a physical components of a computer work and to use arduino kits to allow students to create and analyze circuits, use resistors, and get introduced to Ohm's law while building a series of cool projects and experiments. Especially since students at my school learn physics in 9th grade. They can also code Arduino to start building smart devices that can sense their environment and respond accordingly.

Target audiance: 9 & 10 graders. 

Where it fits along with the other courses in your school:
This will intensely prepare them for the IB Computer Science course where they can combine their knowledge of building websites and using arduino to then create advance programming projects using python. They can use python application to connect to a website that they created and also encorporate it with the electronic aspect of arduino.
