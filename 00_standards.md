00_standards.md Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how. You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

9-12.CY.3: Explain specific trade-offs when selecting and implementing security recommendations.

For this standard, I would first start off by having students discuss pros and cons of different types of Encryption methods. I will then show an example of an encryption method in python and we will discuss how the algorithm works. 
Students will then test their method by giving another pair of students one of their encrypted “passwords” to see if they can crack their code. Once students are happy with their method, they write the code of their method in Python - for encryption and decryption. Students submit, via Google Classroom, the reasons why their encryption method is effective or ineffective as well as their code, and I will select some students to share out to entire class.

Assess personal and societal tradeoffs related to computing technologies and data privacy. 

For this standard:
Warmup: students will first discuss what privacy concerns they would have with their cellphone being lost/stolen, and what business owners would be concerned about if their cellphone is stolen. 
Display: Show the video about facial recognition technology.  Discuss: Students should share notes with their partner about the three prompts and then discuss the provided question "Do you believe the privacy risks posed by facial recognition technology outweigh the benefits/convenience?" Have students share some of their thoughts as a class.
