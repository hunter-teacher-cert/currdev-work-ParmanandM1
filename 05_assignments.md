Student Facing Instructions:
Create a flowchart that will include user input and output to show the steps on converting decimal to hexadecimal and hexadecimal to decimal.


Think, pair, Share. 
1) Write an algorithm/pseudocode that can be translated to python, that will take a user input as a decimal number and converts it to binary
2) Do the same for decimal to hexadecimal.
